# Hotel-Management-System-using-C

Assume that, the receptionist at a hotel asks the name of the person with
their ID number (as given in their ID proof) when they arrive, and
maintains this information. The customers are asked to wait for the room
allotment. Once the room is allotted, it is handed over to the customer after
adding this key number(XX) and status (‘Not Available’) in their record.
As they have only 10 rooms, she can allot a room, only if it is vacant 
(status=’Available’) or when a key is returned. Use a suitable data structure
to assist the receptionist to regulate them. She has to do the following.
<br><br>a. To add the customer ID along with their names, room key number
and status in the list.
<br><br>b. To remove the customer details, when they vacate the room.
<br><br>c. To inform the manager about the number of rooms occupied at a
particular time
<br><br>d. To inform the manager about the person who is staying in the room
number XX.
<br><br>e. To give the room key to the customer when he comes back from
outing by asking his ID number.
